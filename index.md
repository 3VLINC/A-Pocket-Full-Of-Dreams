# Entrepreneur extraordinaire, Nunzio Tumino’s drive to succeed was singular. He literally breathed the qualities that definitively separate the successful from the mega-successful.

The stories of how Nunzio got from there to here define the success he garnered for both himself and his family, underpinned always by the supportive and ongoing partnership with his wife, Maria. And at every juncture, his word was the contract. Known for his generosity and mentorship, Nunzio often placed hard work over family, which sometimes became contentious. Aurora Importing, the crowning heartbeat of Nunzio’s soul, is still famously known for its fine imported goods. A must-read for families who are in business together, as well as for anyone looking to be inspired on their journey to the top.

In thanks to Carmela Morrone Giardini for her continued support as well as guidance throughout this project, proceeds will be donated to The Angel Foundation for Learning, with a prayer that all children be blessed with nourishment for the mind, body and soul as they make their own unique journey through life.
